# 2024-Lok-Sabha-Election-Project-SQL Data analysis
## Overview
The objective of the India Lok Sabha Election 2024 SQL project is to analyze electoral trends by evaluating voter turnout, party-wise seat distribution, and constituency-level performance. The project aims to uncover insights into voting patterns, track shifts in political allegiance, and provide data-driven predictions for future elections.

### Problems and Solutions

JOIN 
   statewise_results sr ON cr.Parliament_Constituency = sr.Parliament_Constituency
